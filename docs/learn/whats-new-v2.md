# What's New in v2

This guide covers what you gain in OneTool MCP v2, followed by upgrade steps and breaking changes.

## New Tool Packs

These packs are entirely new in v2.

### aws — Dynamic proxy to all 57+ official AWSlabs MCP servers `[dev]`

AWS publishes 57 official MCP servers (awslabs) covering everything from S3 and Lambda to Bedrock and Cost Explorer. Without OneTool, using even one of them means paying the full tool tax on every request — and configuring credentials, profiles, SSO, and MFA manually for each. This pack gives you dynamic access to all 57 through a single interface with a fixed, minimal token footprint. Pick servers individually or activate curated role-based bundles (finops, security, compute, data, ml, and 13 more). Credential pre-flight, SSO login, MFA sessions, and profile switching are all handled automatically.

```python
>>> aws_util.whoami()
>>> aws_util.login(profile="dev")
>>> aws_util.start_packs(role="finops")
>>> aws_util.profiles()
```

Also provides `check`, `use`, `mfa`, `roles`, `packs`, `stop_packs`, `refresh_packs`, `services`, `regions`, `arn`, `attributes`, and `values`.

### whiteboard (excalidraw) — Live whiteboard `[dev]`

Turns Excalidraw into a tool-driven canvas. Agents can generate architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and sketches using a Mermaid-compatible DSL, then screenshot or save the result — all without manual drawing. Useful for visual planning, documentation, and sharing ideas that are easier to show than describe.

```python
>>> whiteboard.open()
>>> whiteboard.draw(input="A --> B --> C")
>>> whiteboard.screenshot()
>>> whiteboard.save(path="arch.json")
>>> whiteboard.close()
```

Also provides `load`, `clear`, `erase`, `note`, `scroll`, `zoom`, `fit`, and `hard_reset`. Short alias: `wb`.

### tavily — AI-powered search and URL extraction `[util]`

Tavily is an AI-native search API optimised for LLM pipelines. Results come back clean — titles, URLs, content snippets, and an AI-synthesised answer — all in one call. `output_format` controls the response structure (`"full"`, `"text_only"`, `"sources_only"`), matching the convention used by the `ground` pack. `search_batch()` runs multiple queries in parallel with section labels. `extract_batch()` fetches multiple URL sets concurrently. `research()` submits a deep research task and polls until complete.

```python
>>> tavily.search(query="LLM context window research", output_format="text_only")
>>> tavily.search(query="AI news", topic="news", time_range="week", min_score=0.7)
>>> tavily.search_batch(queries=["React 19 features", "Vue 4 roadmap"])
>>> tavily.extract(urls=["https://example.com/article"])
>>> tavily.extract_batch(url_sets=[(["https://docs.a.com"], "A"), (["https://docs.b.com"], "B")])
>>> tavily.research(input="How does Rust's ownership model work?", model="mini")
```

Requires a `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `secrets.yaml`. Supports topic filters (`general`, `news`, `finance`), domain allow/block lists, time range filtering, relevance score threshold (`min_score`), and configurable result depth.

### chrome_util / play_util — Browser annotations `[dev]`

Two packs that bring visual annotation to browser automation. Inject overlays onto any page, highlight elements with labels and colours, and display step-by-step guidance panels — one driven by Chrome DevTools Protocol, the other by Playwright. The benefit is the same: agents can visually mark up a page to show users exactly what they're looking at or guide them through a multi-step UI workflow.

```python
>>> chrome_util.inject_annotations()
>>> chrome_util.highlight_element(selector="h1", label="Title")
>>> chrome_util.guide_user(instructions="Click the login button")
>>> chrome_util.scan_annotations()
```

### skills — Bundled skill guides

v1 supported user-defined skill files but they were fragile and hard to maintain. v2 replaces them with curated, bundled skill guides covering AWS, Chrome DevTools, Playwright, and more. These are structured Markdown documents that give your LLM the context it needs to use external MCP servers correctly — no manual setup required.

```python
>>> skills.skills()                     # list all skills
>>> skills.skills(name="ot-aws-mcp")   # get full skill content
```

### ot_secrets — Secret encryption

In v1, API keys sat in plain text in `secrets.yaml`. If that file was accidentally committed or shared, every key was exposed. v2 adds transparent age encryption backed by your OS keychain. You generate an identity once, encrypt your secrets file in-place, and from that point on OneTool decrypts values automatically at load time. You can audit which values are still plain, rotate keys, and check keychain status — all without leaving the tool.

```python
>>> ot_secrets.init()                          # generate key, store in keychain
>>> ot_secrets.encrypt(file="secrets.yaml")    # encrypt plain values in-place
>>> ot_secrets.audit(file="secrets.yaml")      # check which values are encrypted
>>> ot_secrets.rotate(file="secrets.yaml")     # rotate to a new key
>>> ot_secrets.status()                        # keychain status
```

### ot_forge — Extension scaffolding

Generates the boilerplate for new tool packs — file structure, type hints, keyword-only args, docstrings — so you can focus on the logic. Also validates extensions before reload, catching issues early.

```python
>>> ot_forge.create_ext(name="my_pack", pack_name="mypack", function="hello")
>>> ot_forge.validate_ext(path="src/mypack.py")
```

### worktree — Parallel agent tasks `[dev]` *(beta)*

Running multiple agents on the same repo is risky — they step on each other's files, create merge conflicts, and lose work. The worktree pack solves this by giving each task an isolated git worktree with its own branch and working directory. Agents can work in parallel without coordination. When a task is done, `commit` squashes, rebases, and pushes to main cleanly.

```python
>>> worktree.add(id="fix-login", description="Fix login timeout")
>>> worktree.list()
>>> worktree.commit(message="fix: resolve login timeout")
>>> worktree.remove(id="fix-login")
```

Also provides `checkout`, `diff`, `status`, `log`, `mark`, `prepare`, and `clean`.

### ot_timer — Named timers

Simple named timers that persist across tool calls. Start a timer before a long operation, check elapsed time after, and compare results. Useful for profiling builds, API calls, or any workflow where you want to measure duration without leaving the conversation.

```python
>>> ot_timer.start(name="build")
>>> ot_timer.elapsed(name="build")
>>> ot_timer.list()
```

## New and Changed Functions in Existing Packs

### file `[util]`

v1's file pack covered the basics — read, write, edit, list, search, delete, copy, move. v2 adds a proper grep with `.gitignore` awareness so searches don't drown in `node_modules` and build artifacts. Batch reads let agents load multiple files in a single call instead of one at a time. The new slice and toc functions bring structured navigation to large files — jump to a section by heading or line range, or get a numbered table of contents to orient before reading.

| Function                   | What it does                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file.grep(pattern, path)` | Regex search across files, respects `.gitignore` by default |
| `file.read_batch(items)`   | Read multiple files in one call                             |
| `file.slice(path, select)` | Extract sections by line range or heading                   |
| `file.slice_batch(items)`  | Extract sections from multiple files                        |
| `file.toc(path)`           | Table of contents for markdown files                        |

### mem `[util]`

v1's memory pack already had semantic search via embeddings. v2 adds `grep` for when you know what you're looking for — exact pattern matching across memory content with line numbers and context lines, like running ripgrep over your knowledge base. This is faster and more precise than semantic search for known terms, error messages, or specific code patterns.

| Function            | What it does                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `mem.grep(pattern)` | Regex search across memory content with context lines |

### context7 `[dev]`

The Context7 integration has been simplified. `search()` now accepts a `limit` parameter to control how many results come back, and `doc()` has a cleaner signature — just pass the library identifier and your query. The underlying API was updated to v2 endpoints with better library resolution and semantic reranking.

### diagram `[dev]`

Adds `get_playground_url(source)` which generates a shareable Kroki playground link for any diagram source. Instead of rendering locally, you can hand someone a URL where they can view and edit the diagram interactively.

## New Features

### Interactive setup with `onetool init`

Getting started no longer means editing YAML by hand. Run `onetool init` and a TUI opens — a checkbox list of every available extension (prompts, servers, security rules, diagram config, snippets, worktree config). Toggle what you want, press enter, and the config files are written for you. Existing files are backed up to `.bak` automatically.

```bash
onetool init -c ~/.onetool
```

### Cleaner config layout

v2 simplifies how config is found and passed to the server:

- **Flat directory** — config lives in `~/.onetool/` directly, not `~/.onetool/config/`
- **Explicit flags** — `--config` and `--secrets` are passed to the server; no implicit discovery
- **Versioned schema** — add `version: 2` to `onetool.yaml`; configs without it are rejected with a clear error rather than silently misbehaving

```bash
onetool --config ~/.onetool/onetool.yaml --secrets ~/.onetool/secrets.yaml
```

### Slim prompts

The system prompt sent to LLMs is now compact (under 25 lines), reducing context overhead and freeing up token budget for your actual work.

### Smarter result navigation

`ot.result()` gains new parameters for navigating large outputs without full pagination:

- **`tail=N`** — last N lines (great for logs)
- **`search="pattern"`** — regex filter within stored results
- **`context=N`** — lines around each match (grep-style)
- **`progress`** — human-readable progress like "lines 1-50 of 343 (15%)"
- **`next_query`** — exact call to fetch the next page

### Optional tool extras

In v1, all tools shipped in a single install. v2 splits heavy-dependency packs into `[util]` and `[dev]` extras for a leaner base install:

| Extra    | Packs                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[util]` | brave, convert, excel, file, ground, mem                                           |
| `[dev]`  | aws, context7, db, diagram, package, ripgrep, web, worktree, whiteboard, and browser utils |
| `[all]`  | Everything                                                                         |

## Upgrading

```bash
uv tool upgrade onetool-mcp
```

Or with optional tool packs:

```bash
uv tool install 'onetool-mcp[all]'     # everything
uv tool install 'onetool-mcp[util]'    # file, convert, excel, brave, ground, mem
uv tool install 'onetool-mcp[dev]'     # ripgrep, db, web, diagram, aws, worktree, ...
```

## Breaking Changes

### Config and MCP setup is now explicit

v1 auto-discovered config and required no arguments. v2 uses explicit `--config` and `--secrets` flags.

**v1 MCP client config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onetool": {
      "command": "onetool"
    }
  }
}
```

**v2 MCP client config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onetool": {
      "command": "onetool",
      "args": [
        "--config", "/path/to/.onetool/onetool.yaml",
        "--secrets", "/path/to/.onetool/secrets.yaml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or via Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add onetool -- onetool --config ~/.onetool/onetool.yaml --secrets ~/.onetool/secrets.yaml
```

Omit `--secrets` if you don't use API keys. Omit `--config` to start with sensible defaults.

### Config version field

Add `version: 2` to your `onetool.yaml`. Configs with `version: 1` are rejected with a clear error.

```yaml
# onetool.yaml
version: 2
# ... rest of config
```

### Config location is flat

The config directory changed from `~/.onetool/config/` to `~/.onetool/` (flat layout). Move your files up one level, or re-run `onetool init`.

### Trigger prefix change

The `__ot` prefix is deprecated. Use `>>>` instead:

```python
# v1
__ot brave.search(query="test")

# v2 (recommended)
>>> brave.search(query="test")
```

`__ot` still works for backward compatibility but is no longer documented or recommended.

### User-defined skills removed

Custom skill files are no longer supported. Built-in skills (like `ot-aws-mcp`, `ot-ref`) are bundled and retrieved via `ot.skills()`.

## Dependency Changes

**New in core:** `pyrage`, `keyring` (secret encryption support)

**Moved to `[util]`:** `openpyxl`, `pymupdf`, `python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `google-genai`, `send2trash`, `pathspec`

**Moved to `[dev]`:** `boto3`, `sqlalchemy`, `trafilatura`, `filelock`, `tabulate`

The base `onetool-mcp` install is significantly lighter. Install `[all]` to get everything back.

---

## Quick Migration Checklist

1. Update install: `uv tool install 'onetool-mcp[all]'` (or pick specific extras)
2. Add `version: 2` to `onetool.yaml`
3. Move config from `~/.onetool/config/` to `~/.onetool/` (or re-run `onetool init`)
4. Update MCP client config to pass `--config` and `--secrets` flags
5. Replace `__ot` with `>>>` in any saved prompts or documentation
