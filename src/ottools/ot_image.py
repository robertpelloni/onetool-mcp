"""Image — session-scoped image loading, vision querying, and summary extraction.

Load images from files, URLs, or the clipboard once; reference them by handle
for follow-up questions. A vision model answers questions and extracts
structured summaries cached in meta.json.

**Configuration (onetool.yaml):**

    tools:
      ot_image:
        vision_model: openai/gpt-4o-mini   # required for ask/summary
        max_edge: 1568                      # default resize limit
        session_cache_size: 10             # default LRU cap

API key and base URL are inherited from ``tools.ot_llm`` if not set.
