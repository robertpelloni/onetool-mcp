> **v1.0.0 Pre-Release** - API stable, actively tested.

OneTool is a local-first MCP server that exposes a single `run` tool for code execution, giving your AI assistant access to unlimited capabilities through one interface.

## The Problem

Connect 5 MCP servers and you've burned 55K tokens before the conversation starts. Connect 10+ and you're at 100K tokens. Your AI gets worse as you add more tools - that's not a bug, it's how context windows work.

## The Solution

**98.7% fewer tokens. Same accuracy. 10x lower cost.**

Instead of loading 50 separate tool schemas, you write Python directly:

```python
__ot brave.search(query="AI trends 2026")
```

No JSON schema parsing. No tool selection loops. No hoping the model guesses correctly. You write explicit code to call APIs - deterministic, visible, no hidden magic.

Based on [Anthropic's research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp), which found token usage dropped from 150,000 to 2,000 when presenting tools as code APIs.

## Core Capabilities

- **30-second setup** - Install with uv or pip
- **Drop-in extensibility** - Add a Python file, get a new pack
- **AST security** - All code validated before execution
- **Benchmark harness** - Test LLM + MCP combinations with `bench`

## Batteries Included with 100+ Tools

See [Tool Reference](docs/tool-reference.md) for the complete list of packs and tools.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install onetool-mcp
```

Or with pip: `pip install onetool-mcp`

**With optional dependencies** (for convert, excel, code search):

```bash
uv tool install onetool-mcp \
  --with pymupdf --with python-docx --with python-pptx \
  --with openpyxl --with Pillow --with duckdb --with openai
```

Add to Claude Code (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onetool": {
      "command": "onetool"
    }
  }
}
```

## Extending

Drop a Python file, get a pack. No registration, no config:

```python
# tools/mytool.py
pack = "mytool"

def search(*, query: str) -> str:
    """Search for something."""
    return f"Results for: {query}"
```

## Why this approach

LLMs write Python instead of parsing JSON schemas. You see what's being called. 2K tokens instead of 150K. Adding your own packs is just dropping in a file.
